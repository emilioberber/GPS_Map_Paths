# GPS-Map-Paths

- Taking Times Square as a GRAPH to collect nodes from this part of the city.
- Selecting 5 couple of nodes (orig node and dest node).
- Apply 5 different algorithms for each node couple.
- Algorithms applied: BFS, DFS, UCS, A* and IDA*.
- Compare the difference between sidewalk graph and not sidewak graph to know if walking or driving is better for a node couple.
